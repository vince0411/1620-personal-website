    <h2 style="font-family:arial;">All about myself</h2>
    <p style="font-family:arial;">Let me begin by introducing myself first. My name is <strong>Vince Enriquez</strong> 
    and I am 19 years old. I immigrated to <em>Canada</em> in 2012 after spending the first 11 years of my life 
    in the <em>Philippines.</em> During my leisure/free time, I usually spend it by <strong>browsing the internet, 
    watching videos, playing video games, and watching live sports on TV (especially basketball and football)</strong>. 
    In terms of my previous school experience, I graduated from elementary school in 2014 and graduated from 
    high school in 2019. I have had some previous post-secondary experience in <em>Vancouver Community College 
    (VCC).</em> in the previous year, as I took <strong>Anatomy and Physiology</strong> and tried to pursue a career in the medical
     field before I decided to change course and instead pursue a career in Information Technology by taking 
     the <strong>two-year CIT diploma program in BCIT</strong>. The factors that caused me to choose BCIT as a post-secondary
     institution of choice is that it will help me to explore the world of computers and technology in further 
     detail so that I am able to have the tools and resources I need to pursue a successful work career in 
     computers and information systems in the future, especially in work companies such as <em>Microsoft</em>.
